A fullstack messenger project created soley using swift. 

The Frontend...
- MVC design pattern
- UI designed using a combination of programatic code and storyboard.
- Used protocols and delegates to pass information between view controllers.
- Vigorous error handling system
- Used Structs and Enums used to keep code more maintainable and DRY.
- Used Cocoapods to access different utilities such as suitable Firebase pods and SDWebImage.


The Backend...
- REST API created in swift
- Websockets implemented via Firebase's real time database
- Authentication implmented using Firebase Auth.
- Used Firebase real time database to store non-relational data.
